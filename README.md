# Understanding Gen-Z

Understanding Gen-Z is a self-initiated research and content project built as a simple website.

The goal of this project is to understand how Gen-Z thinks, feels, and reacts to modern social and cultural topics, rather than judging those behaviours.

The website explores topics such as:
- Mental health and emotional awareness
- Culture, taboos, and social change
- Fashion and identity
- Relationships and communication
- Career thinking and uncertainty

The content is written in simple, respectful, and non-judgmental language.

The website is available in English, Hindi, and Gujarati and works smoothly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
